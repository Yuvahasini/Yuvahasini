- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yuvahasini
- Computer Science student who enjoys turning complex concepts into clean, workable logic. Curious about how algorithms actually behave in real systems — not just on paper.
- I like breaking problems down until they look simple enough to code.
- Actively improving my understanding of core CS fundamentals — DSA, operating systems, and problem-solving patterns.
- I prefer simple, readable solutions over clever but confusing ones.
